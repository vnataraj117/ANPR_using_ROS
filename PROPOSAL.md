## Project Objective
This project will simulate a robot in a parking lot recognizing number plate characters from cars in the lot. 

## Contributions
A robot which can recognize number plate characters has various application in the real world including help give parking tickets as well as tracking cars going in and out of a lot.

## Project Plan
The characters on the number plate itself will be recognized using OpenCV and the code will be implemented in ROS using Python as the scripting language.
A parking lot world in gazebo will be generated.
The robot could be moved around the world using a controller   

## Milestones
- [x] Complete this proposal document. 
- [x] Get the number plate recognition code to work
- [x] Get the tele-op bot style implementation to work with the character recognition code
- [ ] Test the code out by feeding it some basic number plates to see if it actually returns the correct character values
- [ ] Generate a parking lot world in Gazebo
- [ ] Get the robot to move in the parking lot using a controller (?)
- [ ] Test again to see whether the robot is actually getting the correct characters off the cars
- [ ] Create final documentation and get the presentations done
- [ ] Create final report  


## Measures of Success
- [x] Number plate recognition code works 
- [ ] Robot moves with a xbox controller 
- [ ] The robot can move and recognize plates
- [ ] World is generated
- [ ] Robot moves around world and recognizes plates
